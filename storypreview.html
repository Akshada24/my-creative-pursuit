                                                             The Odd Man Out

Year 2008
Rain hit the window as she put her forehead on the cool glass. She watched children playing on the street below. Some hid under umbrellas, while others played in the rain, laughing as water hit the ground.
Her grandfather put his weathered hand on her shoulder. "Why don't you join them? You've always loved games," he said kindly.
She stayed quiet, watching the scene below. The girls sat under a flowering tree, playing with dolls and whispering to each other. Nearby, boys jumped in puddles, trying to make the biggest splash. Two separate groups, neither with room for her.
Grandfather watched as she came to understand that she belonged nowhere. His deep eyes observed her face, free of judgment. Though known for his wisdom, he never imposed it on others. Instead, he gently guided them to discover it for themselves.
Without speaking, she went outside and walked through the wet streets to the group of girls. At first, they moved away from her, making their circle tighter.
"We don't need anyone else," one said with the simple cruelty that children often use.
But she didn't leave. Rain stuck her hair to her forehead as she stood firm. After whispering and dramatic sighs, they let her join—but as the family dog. Her job: sit in the corner, eat from a special plate, and stay invisible.
This time, she accepted this role quietly. Before, when she tried to join their games, they argued. Her ideas were creative and clever, but she always tried to be the boss. What looked like rejection was really rebellion—the girls were tired of her always trying to control everything.
The boys weren't any more welcoming. When she approached them, holding a football as a peace offering, the same thing happened. She tried to organize their wild game with strict rules. They rejected her completely, calling her too "girlish" to play with them—though she was actually quite strong. Once, after a heated argument, a boy kicked the ball at her leg on purpose, leaving a bruise she later blamed on falling down stairs when her parents asked. They knew she was lying but didn't push when she said it wasn't important.
Their neighbourhood had small houses and gardens where children played in the street. As she played her role as the "dog," her mother saw her from the kitchen window. Misunderstanding the situation, her mother stormed out and dragged her home, angry about "those horrible children." Her mother didn't know what was really happening. She banned her daughter from playing with "those girls" and promised to buy the video game console she had been asking for.
But games no longer interested her. She wanted real connections—friends who understood her and valued her ideas without feeling threatened.
Her grandfather had seen everything. He knew his granddaughter wasn't typical—she was very smart, creative, and a natural leader. Her need to control every situation pushed away potential friends. She was like her father that way—an ambitious businessman who cared more about his vision than personal relationships. He had risen from poverty through determination, a quality that first attracted her mother but eventually drove them apart. Now, after a bitter split, mother and daughter lived with the grandfather. Her grandmother had died three years earlier. 
The girl took after her father in many ways. She had been close to him as a child, but now refused to speak to him, her anger at his leaving still fresh. For two years, she had kept her silence, ever since learning the painful truth about why he left.
She had gotten his leadership qualities but not his comfort with being alone. Though Grandfather admired his son-in-law's dedication and ability to face failure and start again, he saw that the man was fundamentally alone. Despite professional success at a young age, he had no real friends or trusted colleagues to help during hard times. Strangely, this loneliness seemed to suit him.
His daughter, however, was different. She had her mother's compassion and commitment to those she loved. She would sacrifice anything for them. During her grandmother's illness, she had stayed by her bedside through long nights, reading favourite stories, sharing laughter, listening with genuine interest even when disagreeing. Her love for her grandmother was stronger than her usual stubbornness. Unlike her father, she needed connection—a quality that worried her grandfather. She needed to balance being true to herself with being flexible if she hoped to find happiness.
Many talented people miss opportunities not because they lack ability but because they lack humility. Exceptional talent rarely moves forward through normal paths—the world naturally resists those who stand out. Politics exists everywhere, from schoolyards to boardrooms.
Grandfather understood his task clearly and planned his approach carefully.
With no other playmates available, he became her companion. He disliked modern entertainment, especially the idea of a child playing video games all day. With school holidays ahead, he needed to create meaningful activities that would teach valuable lessons without seeming like teaching. Time was plentiful, and his preference for ancient games that taught life principles would help them both.
Chess was his first attempt, but she already knew the game and found nothing new in it. She needed something fresh to capture her restless mind. Then he remembered ‘Go’.
While ‘Chess’ and ‘Go’ seem similar as strategy board games, they require different thinking approaches. Chess demands tactical calculation, memorized sequences, and predictable progressions. Go involves abstract thinking, seemingly endless possibilities, and long-term planning that feels almost like intuition.
Go began in China about 2,500 years ago and is played on a 19×19 grid with 361 intersections. Players take turns placing stones on these points—180 white stones and 181 black stones (black moves first, needing an extra stone for balance). Once placed, stones stay unless captured by being completely surrounded by the opponent's pieces. The goal: control more territory than your opponent when no good moves remain.
Traditionally played by emperors, scholars, and military strategists, Go has recently caught the attention of computer scientists as an artificial intelligence challenge because of its incredible complexity. Unlike chess, where computer power eventually let machines win, Go required a more human-like approach to strategic thinking.
Her eyes lit up when she learned emperors had played this game. She had always been fascinated by stories of royalty and power. The elegant wooden board with its simple black and white stones promised mental adventure after weeks of boredom.

Years later, spotlights shine on a composed woman in a nice suit as she takes her place on stage. The announcer introduces her as a business success—a self-made millionaire before thirty with multiple companies under her control. Women across industries admire her unique mix of power and genuine humility. She sits in the interview chair with practiced grace.
Interviewer: "Who would you credit for your extraordinary success?"
She smiles, her eyes softening with memory. "My grandfather. Grandpa, if you're watching—thank you for playing games with me."
Interviewer: "Was your grandfather also in business like your father?"
She laughs warmly. "Not at all. He worked a regular job. He was just..." she pauses, looking for the right words, "an ordinary grandfather with extraordinary wisdom."
Interviewer: "Then how did he teach business principles?"
"He never directly taught me about business. He taught me about life through the simplest way—a game called Go."
Interviewer: "Would you share some of those lessons with your followers?"
As she says "Go," the big screen behind her shows an image of the ancient game board. Looking at it, time seems to fold in on itself, taking her back to golden afternoons filled with quiet focus and deep discovery.
________________________________________
Lessons of the Game
Grandfather had learned Go from a Chinese colleague in his company who had patiently taught him its complexities. Their regular matches had sharpened his skills until he eventually became better than his teacher, though he never mentioned this.
While generally gentle and understanding in daily life, as a teacher, he changed—becoming strict, demanding discipline and focused attention. Each lesson went beyond the game board.
"Life itself is an elaborate game of Go," he often said. "Most people play without seeing the board beneath their feet. Some move with purpose, others just react. All lives cross on this vast grid. People come and go like black and white stones—some support you, others oppose you, some try to replace you, others follow you. The only way to lead effectively is knowing exactly where yo	u belong and finding your perfect position—not fixed forever, but right for achieving your current goals."
Lesson 1: Observe
Grandfather didn't explain the rules or show her how to play. Instead, he simply said: "Observe."
The first week, they finished a new game every day. Their first game lasted nine painful hours, ending only when her mother insisted, they stop for dinner. She thought carefully before each move, analysing possibilities, yet learning nothing clear—the game remained mysterious chaos. The second day was similar.
He suggested that patterns become clear only when time speeds up, so they started using a thirty-minute timer per game. After three quick matches, she discovered a basic rule: stones surrounded by the opponent's colour disappeared from the board.
In the next game, she created multiple enclosures to capture his isolated stones. She did well, winning several small victories while missing the bigger strategic picture, ultimately losing the game.
The next day, she focused on building a large "fortress" from the beginning. While focusing on this grand design, she lost many small battles until she ran out of resources and couldn't complete her vision.
She gradually understood the crucial balance between small details and the big picture—between immediate tactical advantages and long-term strategic positioning. She realized the game's true essence went beyond memorized rules to embrace adaptive strategy. As her understanding grew deeper, games lasted longer, her focus sharpened, and her approaches became more sophisticated.
She learned concepts remarkably quickly, mastering complex strategies faster than most adults. Within a week, she had completed her first lesson in the basics.
She thought they had unlimited time together, but life unexpectedly intervened. Her mother received a job offer in another city. Having sacrificed her career to raise her daughter, she now needed to reclaim her independence. At her father's suggestion, she had begun searching for work and, surprisingly quickly, found a position that required moving within seven days.
When her daughter learned about the move, she was upset. Just as she had found something truly engaging, she faced separation from her grandfather. "I haven't finished learning," she protested.
Grandfather responded calmly: "There's no benefit in learning everything at once. You must practice each lesson before moving forward. Besides, you need new surroundings and friends your own age. You enjoy playing with other children, don't you? Make new connections."
"No, they all hate me," she replied bitterly. 
"Do you know why?" he asked.
"Of course—because they're stupid and I'm smart. That's why they hate me."
"No. Absolutely wrong."
“Then why do you think they hate me?”
"That’s your assignment to complete until next visit. Discover why they reject you by applying your first lesson. Do you remember what it is?"
"Observe."
"Yes. It sounds simple, but it's the most challenging skill to master. The hardest task any human faces. Most people don't truly observe—they merely react. Real observation requires stillness, patience, and silence. Seeing isn't enough; you must recognize patterns. Personal bias often hides accurate perception. Deep observation demands emotional control. And most challenging of all: observing yourself. We struggle to see our own thoughts and behaviours without judgment. Your assignment: master observation within six months. When we meet again, you'll show me your progress."
This might seem like advanced instruction for a twelve-year-old, but she was smarter than most kids her age. Her grandfather remained confident in her ability to succeed.
The agreement was set—she would return in six months to show her development, and he would teach her the next lesson.
A full year passed before they met again. Her mother fell ill, needing care and help with household responsibilities. Previously, she would have avoided these duties through argument and resistance, but she now understood they needed each other. Her usual stubbornness had begun to soften. Perhaps this change happened because she had embraced her grandfather's lesson: observe, stay calm, practice patience. Through patience, she recognized her mother's dedication and kindness, her tireless efforts for both their welfare. Rather than insisting on visiting her grandfather, she stayed with her mother.
Throughout that year, she gained significant insights. At her new school, she initially kept distance from classmates, focusing on observation. She noticed how friendships formed through mutual help, shared laughter, and common experiences. She applied these observations to form connections, achieving moderate success in creating a small social circle. However, she couldn't be her true self with any of them or speak freely without filtering her thoughts. This constant performance tired her. Sometimes, people took advantage of her deliberate kindness. But she developed skill in reading intentions, distinguishing between those seeking advantage and those offering genuine care.
As her observation skills grew, she discovered the world's endless complexity—not just people but environments, systems, relationships, even seemingly lifeless objects revealed patterns and information.
Finally, the time came for her second lesson. Since finishing exams, excitement had built within her, prompting frequent calls to her grandfather. She noticed his trembling voice during calls and researched nutritional needs for elderly men, bringing specially selected healthy snacks when they reunited. Her mother expressed pride in this thoughtfulness.
Upon arrival, she presented her carefully chosen gifts. Finding him watering garden plants, she took over the task, giving each plant exactly the right amount of water based on its pot size, providing extra for those showing signs of thirst. Her attention to detail made him smile quietly.
Lesson 2: The First Move Decides Your Future
She hadn't played Go for twelve months but had resisted looking up strategies or information on her own. That particular world existed only for exploration with him—that's what made it special.
After their year apart, they sat in the garden after dinner. He asked for a demonstration of her observation skills but declared she had already passed that test through her actions since arriving. That evening, they discussed various topics—her new school, the city, her surroundings, her friendships (a subject she addressed satisfactorily but deliberately vaguely). He immediately understood the core problem remained unsolved.
The next morning, they positioned themselves under a spreading oak tree. Birds made natural music overhead while gentle breezes moved nearby bushes—a scene like tranquil moments from Studio Ghibli films. They opened the board, and she prepared to learn new wisdom. This match lasted about four hours. Despite the long absence from play, she applied life-learned skills surprisingly well, noting her own improvement with satisfaction.
After finishing, her grandfather explained, "The opening move sets the direction for the entire game. A weak beginning creates growing difficulties." She realized how much she needed to consider possibilities for both his moves and hers because her initial placement had been random rather than strategic. "The first move determines future possibilities. Early life choices shape available paths. Begin with strength, plan extensively, and never waste opportunities."
With the game completed, he addressed the topic she had carefully avoided—friendships. She confessed how she suppressed her true reactions, observed others' expectations, and tried to meet them regardless of personal cost.
After listening carefully, he asked, "Do you know how many genuine friends I currently have? People with whom I share my complete self?"
She replied, "You're an exceptional person. Surely dozens."
"No. I have exactly one true friend—someone I regularly argued with since childhood, almost an enemy for years. Now he remains the only person who truly understands me. Our friendship developed without analysis or strategy. We simply existed together, tolerating disagreements, listening to problems, offering support during difficulties. That's how friendship formed without conscious effort. Never manufacture friendships through calculation—that's deeply harmful to your true self. Allow relationships to develop naturally. Friends aren't required to consistently support or agree with you. Wise people observe that your friends define your character, which contains deep truth. The real secret: we never find friends—we attract them through our actions. Never compromise your essence to secure friendship. Follow your genuine interests, and people with complementary energy will find you. Quality is more important than quantity in relationships. Stop analysing when forming personal connections.”
"Two different relationship categories exist: friends developed naturally, and strategic connections forming your professional network. Network contacts represent mutually beneficial exchanges. Choose these people carefully and interact thoughtfully. Future needs remain unpredictable. Mind your approach and communication style. Learn appropriate boundaries for what to share. When navigating opportunities within groups, your first action—your first words or behaviours—creates possibilities. This approach eliminates unnecessary effort and constant worry about consequences. You'll save valuable time and energy."
The lesson quota for this vacation was complete. The following months would focus on practical application.
In later games, she explored multiple possibilities starting from identical positions, changing gameplay to understand board dynamics completely. Her approach impressed him greatly. While millions of possibilities exist from any starting point—impossible to explore them all—her method showed sound reasoning. Experience doesn't need to teach every possible move; pattern recognition reveals probable outcomes.
For five weeks, she played with intense focus until achieving personal satisfaction. Her departure date approached, but this time anticipation replaced disappointment. She eagerly looked forward to applying new understanding to real situations.
She couldn't rebuild impressions with familiar acquaintances. Once people form opinions, changing them requires extraordinary demonstration of value. The previous school year, she had presented herself as an average student while prioritizing making friends. Her grades had been adequate but unremarkable. Now, she would show her full abilities.
She began participating in activities regardless of whether her friends were involved, joining multiple subject groups preparing for competitions. This approach helped her connect with students from different classes—people offering fresh starts without preconceptions. Gradually, she built a reputation as an intellectually gifted student. Test scores improved dramatically. Some avoided her deliberately, some she strategically avoided, some sought her friendship, while others were jealous. None of these reactions disturbed her balance. She had prepared thoroughly since learning her lesson. Being her true self provided tremendous satisfaction. She developed two close friendships within her class and additional connections through activities outside class.
The previous year, missing her grandfather badly, she had called him often. Now, engaged with new friendships and challenges, she called less frequently. This development pleased him, knowing she must be finding fulfilment.
That year, at the end of the semester, she participated in a national science and technology competition. She approached the event confident her team would probably win, but seeing projects from across the country revealed significant gaps in her knowledge and skills. Meeting numerous talented peers made her question her own abilities. The year ended with unexpected disappointment.
Lesson 3: Control the Corners Before the Centre
She visited her grandfather again after another year apart. Their phone conversations had been pleasant, creating expectations of enthusiasm when they met. Instead, she arrived sighing heavily, showing little excitement even about seeing him. She typically enjoyed discussing technology and science, displaying pride in her knowledge, but now looked like a defeated warrior returning from an unsuccessful battle.
Her mother explained what happened after the school competition. Though her daughter had never directly discussed it, she had obviously expected to win and felt deeply disappointed. When no mention followed the event, she realized her daughter had been deeply affected by the outcome.
Grandfather disliked empty words and conventional advice. He preferred teaching through stories and experience. This situation needed a specific lesson he immediately identified.
Previously, she had always started their games, asking him to play. This time, he needed to take the lead.
They took their familiar positions. He moved first, placing his stone with deliberate precision. She responded without serious thought, and this pattern continued for about thirty minutes. He expected her to gradually engage, but she remained distracted and defeated.
"This match serves no purpose," she declared flatly. "The winner is predetermined."
"Then why continue?" His tone changed to commanding authority—he had never spoken to her so severely before. He collected all pieces methodically and put them away. "Game over. You're dismissed."
She recognized her mistake immediately.
"Don't waste my time if you don't intend to participate properly. I'm not a child looking for casual entertainment. I've spent twenty years mastering this game. Practice and commitment developed my expertise. You clearly understand nothing about true mastery. Do you think champions automatically succeed in their first attempts? Some achieve early victory, not through natural talent, but through different thinking processes, improving when no one is watching, and constant mental engagement with principles. No champion emerges without dedicated practice."
Properly chastened, she apologized sincerely, and they started again with a better attitude and focus.
Her grandfather had won several international championships during his professional career. No one knew about this achievement because he never talked about a game few appreciated or understood.
She started play by controlling corner positions—a strategy she had developed on her own before his explanation. Now she would understand its underlying principles.
He asked, "Why begin with corners?"
"They provide defensive advantages," she explained. "Limited escape routes and attack directions. Control requires minimal space—efficient territory acquisition. This approach creates confident game start."
"Then why not expand exclusively from corners? You previously emphasized central importance—whoever controls the centre dominates the game."
"Only when sufficient strength exists to maintain that position."
"Initial central positioning creates vulnerability to crushing defeat. Conversely, chance victory may produce blinding success and celebration while opponents quietly advance strategically. Prioritize small, controlled encounters before addressing larger challenges. This represents effective preparation for eventual confrontation."
She understood his metaphorical meaning perfectly. The insight seemed obvious now—development time remained available. This setback was temporary learning rather than final judgment. After their game, she explored his extensive library containing books on scientific theory, engineering principles, and business strategy.
Her vacation schedule established a predictable rhythm: afternoon strategic games with grandfather and evenings immersed in knowledge acquisition—purposeful and satisfying.
This year ended in the wise company of books.
Lesson 4: Sacrifices Are Sometimes Necessary
School responsibilities prevented summer vacation visits as she prepared for crucial twelfth-grade final exams. Instead, she arranged a mid-semester visit. Significant change had occurred—she had developed strong dislike toward educational routines and standardized tests. Nothing offered novelty or mental stimulation. Peers followed identical paths without real vocational direction or self-knowledge.
During her previous visit, she had discovered writings about revolutionary thinkers, transformative ideas, and complex systems—both mechanical and social. She increasingly viewed formal education as wasted time, focusing on trivial assignments and examinations rather than meaningful intellectual exploration. She considered quitting formal education to start an independent venture addressing real societal needs.
Weekly arguments with her mother had become routine. Her mother had expected academic excellence without complications, but teacher complaints multiplied—not paying attention during lectures, incomplete assignments, rebellious classroom behaviour. Initially, her mother had expected temporary issues, knowing her daughter avoided frivolous activities in favour of serious reading and independent learning. Eventually, she recognized the fundamental problem and argued passionately that formal credentials remained essential in modern society—education represented the only path toward professional credibility.
Her daughter remained unconvinced by these arguments. Her mother believed only her grandfather could potentially influence this increasingly independent thinking.
Grandfather immediately understood her perspective without needing persuasion. She knew he would understand her position intuitively. She spoke extensively while he listened attentively for hours, describing revolutionary thinkers she had discovered and her preparation for joining their ranks.
He listened patiently until her enthusiasm naturally subsided. Recognizing it wasn't the right time for direct contradiction, they began playing instead. He saved explicit advice for later, subtly planting conceptual seeds for future consideration.
During gameplay, he deliberately created scenarios requiring choices between immediate success and long-term positional sacrifice. Initially, she didn't recognize this pattern, but as gameplay progressed, every move involved sacrifice considerations. Her progress stalled completely. Respecting his strategic wisdom, she avoided impulsive decisions and fruitless arguments. Gradually, she identified his underlying message, though he had said nothing directly.
She stopped playing mid-game. Several minutes of deep silence followed.
"Do you really believe I'm pursuing foolish objectives?" she finally asked.
"No. You understand my message perfectly. Strategic sacrifices are sometimes necessary. Releasing certain stones preserves broader positional advantage. Not every concept or strategy succeeds consistently."
"But action must come before complete understanding of correct approaches."
"Accurate observation. However, what purpose is there in abandoning partially completed endeavours? More importantly, have you identified any concept worth sacrificing current investments?"
"No."
"Then make thoughtful decisions now. Otherwise, you'll waste accumulated advantages—that represents real waste. No one expects academic perfection. Apply enough effort to secure acceptable scores that won't limit university options, where resources for your vision will become available. Remember, our world operates unpredictably and favours system participants. Those challenging established structures face unexpected obstacles. Maintaining backup plans demonstrates wisdom during chaotic periods. Have you developed any concept or product justifying sacrifice of secure future possibilities?"
"No."
"Then your course becomes clear."
The vacation ended early, without any significant progress in her game strategy. She had a real battle coming up soon.
After four months of internal resistance and external conflict, she finally achieved psychological balance regarding her educational path.
Lesson 5: The Odd Man Out Rule - Avoid Isolation
After finishing exams, she visited during holiday break. Results weren't announced yet. This time, the lesson came before obvious problems—though she already understood the challenges of being different while maintaining connection.
Grandfather observed her increasing maturity and wisdom, recognizing her clear objectives and willingness to pursue them diligently. He also identified problems such people frequently encounter: profound loneliness. They must learn to release attachments, adapt to isolation, and advance independently. Having even one supportive companion represents extraordinary luck. As a woman in leadership positions, she would face additional challenges requiring greater sacrifices. He believed this lesson represented critical knowledge—potentially preventing significant future difficulties.
They had played Go for four years consistently. She had mastered numerous techniques and developed original strategies. Matches had grown increasingly complex and exciting as she approached her first decisive victory. For two years, she had studied professional matches extensively, refining her approach methodically. Her main goal now focused on defeating him before reaching adulthood. During this vacation, she prepared extensively for this specific challenge, showing clear vision and defined goals.
After fifteen days of intensive competition, she finally secured victory. He had exhausted available counter-strategies—or more accurately, her approach had exceeded his anticipated responses. He had prepared for this eventual outcome after watching her play for several months. Both felt equal satisfaction. He expected triumphant celebration, but saw profound gratitude rather than victory in her expression.
She suddenly realized the usual lesson hadn't been presented. He typically introduced them at the beginning of their extended strategic sessions.
"Grandfather, what principle does this season teach?" she asked.
He smiled warmly. "You've defeated me conclusively. Do you still need more lessons?"
"Absolutely! What strange question is that? I'll always need guidance regardless of age or accomplishment."
"Very well. Today's principle I'll state directly, while you provide explanation: 'Always follow the odd man out rule. Avoid isolation.'"
She responded thoughtfully, "I've applied this principle unconsciously since your first lesson. An isolated stone surrounded by opponent pieces gets captured, while multiple connected stones provide mutual support. Connections determine survival possibilities. Without allies, survival becomes impossible."
"Correct observation. How does this translate to practical application?"
"Avoid solitary endeavours—they create unnecessary struggle. Develop strong supportive networks."
"Your answer contains partial truth but remains incomplete."
"What's the missing component?"
"I'll reveal that when genuine need arises."
"Understood."
She never questioned his teaching methods. Such questioning served no purpose—he would never respond to demands. His teaching approach, while unconventional, produced consistently effective results.
Lesson 6: The Game Ends, But the Lessons Continue
University studies immersed her in diverse activities—competitions, events, and intellectual pursuits. Two years passed without opportunity to visit her grandfather, though occasional phone-conversations maintained connection. She noticed his gradually declining health and strength, recognizing the importance of arranging a visit.
Those years passed uneventfully for him without significant changes—life maintained peaceful rhythm. For her, that period similarly accelerated, but contained numerous experiences and discoveries. She developed conceptual frameworks, presented innovations, collaborated with talented peers—experiencing life's richness fully.
The formal lessons approached conclusion. Her increasing responsibilities would provide experiential learning opportunities. She required minimal additional formal instruction—she had internalized fundamental principles for effective living.
Before beginning their game, her grandfather made an unexpected announcement. He formally ended his position as master instructor. Throughout their relationship, they had maintained traditional teacher-student dynamics. Now he requested friendship—someone with whom she could share challenges, express frustrations about difficult personalities, discuss humorous encounters, or explore emerging opportunities. Both needed such authentic connection.
Since her previous victory, her skills had developed substantially. Her grandfather now struggled against her strategic innovations—her play had become delightfully unpredictable. His traditional approach emphasized safety margins, contingency planning, and holistic board visualization rather than isolated confrontations. Her style demonstrated greater intensity, securing tactical advantages while gradually establishing dominant positioning. She had specifically engineered this approach to counter his methodology.
Previously, she had competed against one of his longtime associates, employing refined strategy emphasizing comprehensive positional control. Her grandfather recognized her developing ability to analyse opponent tendencies and adapt accordingly.
Subsequently, she secured victory in most matches, establishing significant performance difference.
During one particularly intense game, he asked unexpectedly, "What quality do you consider uniquely fascinating about human potential?"
"Imagination," she replied without hesitation. "Einstein identified this correctly, and I completely agree. Humanity has built remarkable futures because individuals imagined possibilities beyond existing parameters."
"I agree entirely. However, another quality must align with this capacity—freedom to experience failure. Humans make errors, extract learning, adapt approaches, and develop resilience. That process creates fundamental strength. We must explore novel approaches and continue learning through inevitable mistakes."
His observation contained profound truth. Revolutionary innovations would remain undiscovered without persistent efforts transforming imagination into practical reality. Centuries of cumulative effort had produced systems providing modern benefits—electrical distribution, medical institutions, electronic technologies, mechanical innovations.
That day, he secured unexpected victory—following ten consecutive defeats. Perhaps he had applied extraordinary concentration to demonstrate continuing relevance as instructor.
Their final formal master-disciple engagement concluded with brilliant strategic execution and victory margin of precisely one point—exactly matching his opening prediction.
"I will secure victory by single-point margin," he had confidently stated.
And he did exactly that. He wasn't experiencing mental decline—simply physical aging. At their separation, he demonstrated continuing mastery convincingly.
Following the game, they talked extensively about university experiences, funny incidents, and shared memories. They laughed together frequently, beginning their new relationship dynamic.
Their interactions became mostly light-hearted and mutually engaging. Occasionally she shared concerns about professional development, personal relationships, friendship dynamics, parental interactions, technological evolution, societal transformation, and potential problem-solving approaches. He listened attentively without offering prescriptive suggestions. He recognized she needed supportive presence rather than explicit guidance. He fulfilled this role perfectly.
Two additional years passed with this understanding.
On her graduation day, after formal ceremonies, she immediately visited her grandfather, who had prepared a celebration. She arrived wearing formal academic regalia, presenting herself as a dignified, accomplished woman. Observing her transformation from frustrated child gazing through windows to confident professional prepared to influence global systems, he felt immense pride and deep satisfaction.
After dinner, they sat in their usual garden spot.
"Do you remember our incomplete lesson discussion?" she asked.
"Certainly. How could such important matters escape memory? I assumed you had figured out the answer on your own."
"I believe so, but confirmation would provide reassurance."
"Please remind me of the specific principle."
"The odd man out rule—avoid isolation. However, I've identified the missing component: You must recognize situations where you are the outlier within your current group. When identified, either find individuals who accept your differences, or develop enough strength to thrive despite uniqueness."
"So, you've discovered power dynamics without explicit instruction."
"Is my understanding correct?"
"What assessment have you formed regarding your personal characteristics?"
"Look at this watch. Father gave it to me celebrating graduation achievement. He visited personally, though we haven't communicated much for years. He consistently acknowledged mother's and my birthdays with thoughtful gifts—intellectually stimulating books, seminar invitations, fascinating technological innovations discovered internationally, or simply photos of places he thought would interest me. He invited me to join his travels, which I always declined. After years understanding both him and myself, I recognize our fundamental similarity. I resented his ambition and departure, but share those exact qualities. I understand him more completely now, and consequently, understand myself.
"I've learned that conviction requires finding appropriate collaborators to achieve objectives. Sometimes sacrifices become necessary, including relationships with beloved individuals. Such sacrifices remain optional when inadequately justified. Ultimately, you must face your reflection with pride regarding your choices."
"Have you forgiven him?"
"I'm working toward that goal. I no longer resist his presence—I've even asked for driving lessons from him. Perhaps this change comes not from understanding him, but from understanding myself. I fear potential future consequences and hope that forgiving him might someday inspire forgiveness from those I love."
